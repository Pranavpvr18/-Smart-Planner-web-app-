# Icons

Place your app icons here:
- icon-192.png (192x192 pixels)
- icon-512.png (512x512 pixels)

For now, the app will work without these icons, but they're recommended for a complete PWA experience.

You can generate icons from:
- https://www.pwabuilder.com/imageGenerator
- https://realfavicongenerator.net/
- Or create custom icons in any image editor

The app uses emoji icons (📚) in the UI, so the PWA icons are optional for basic functionality.
